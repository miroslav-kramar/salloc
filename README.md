Malloc/free-like API to perform dynamic allocations on the stack.

This implementation assumes C11 standard. However, with slight tweaks, C99 is achievable.

## Example usage

### Basic example

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "salloc.h"

int main() {
    // allocation
    const size_t SIZE = 10;
    int * a = salloc(SIZE * sizeof(int));

    // write
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        a[i] = i;
    }

    // read
    for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
        printf("%d\n", a[i]);
    }

    // deallocation
    sfree(a);
    return 0;
}
```

### Reallocation
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "salloc.h"

int main() {
    const size_t SIZE = 10;
    int * a = salloc(SIZE * sizeof(int));
    if (a == NULL) return 1;

    memset(a, 11, sblock_size(a));

    int * tmp = srealloc(a, SIZE * 2 * sizeof(int));
    if (tmp == NULL) return 1;

    memset(a, 22, sblock_size(a));

    heap_dump();
    bitmap_dump();
    sfree(a);
    return 0;
}
```

### Alignment
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdalign.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "salloc.h"

int main() {
    // allocate a block of memory aligned to 16 bytes
    int * a = salloc(sizeof(*a) * 10);
    // allocate a block of memory with specific alignment
    int * b = salloc_aligned(sizeof(*a) * 10, alignof(*a));

    // write to memory
    memset(a, 11, sblock_size(a));
    memset(b, 22, sblock_size(b));

    // heap and bitmap raw value dump
    heap_dump();
    bitmap_dump();
    putchar('\n');

    // freeing the allocated memory
    sfree(a);
    sfree(b);

    // view heap and bitmap after deallocation
    heap_dump();
    bitmap_dump();
    putchar('\n');

    return 0;
}
```

## Building

The library implementation uses only standard C. It can be compiled as:

```bash
gcc main.c salloc.c -Wall
```

Default heap size is 8192. If you want custom heap size, then compile with

```bash
gcc main.c salloc.c -DHEAP_SIZE=65536
```

## A little story on how it was built

### Global state
The whole library is built around 3 global variables, `heap`, `bitmap` and `metadata_byte_size`(more on that later).

Heap is a statically allocated array of `uint8_t`. It contains all the issued blocks of memory by the stack allocator.

Bitmap has exactly the same ammount of bits as there are bytes in heap. It tracks all the issued bytes in heap by storing their state in bit on the corresponding index.

### Allocation
When a block of size `S` is requested, the allocator goes through the bitmap until it finds not-yet-issued memory. It first counts whether or not there are enough free bytes to match the requested size + metadata. If so, then it marks all the corresponding bits in the bitmap as issued and returns a pointer to the block.

### Metadata?

As it might already occoured to you, the bitmap is used for allocation by tracking which bytes are already issued and which are not.

When we want to free this issued memory, we can simply compute the starting index of this memory by subtracting the heap pointer from the issued block pointer. But to be able to free the memory, we must also know how large the issued block is. And the information about length is stored as metadata right before the block itself.

When we allocate the block, we actually allocate a bit more, exactly `metadata_byte_size` more, creating a "metablock". Of course, we do not want to return pointer to the metablock, so the user is not bothered by this. Instead, we offset the pointer by `metadata_byte_size`, so it points to the block (data) part.

### metadata_byte_size?

When designing the library, I thought about how many bytes should the metadata occupy. `sizeof(size_t)` was the first candidate, and a good candidate. But not good enough. Since we are allocating on the stack, which is significantly smaller than the heap, we should optimize for memory usage.

If the user, for example, decides to define the heap as `4096` bytes large, then the maximum sized block of memory we can issue is sligtly less than that. Full `size_t` worth of memory (8 bytes on a modern 64bit system) is arguably overkill. `4096` fits well into just 2 bytes (`short int`) of memory. So I decided to compute the number of bytes the metadata of each block should occupy based on the heap size. 

The formula for computing the minimum number of bytes to store the block size is:

```
bytes = ceil(log2(HEAP_SIZE+1)) / CHAR_BIT
```

Ceil? And base 2 logarithm?! Yikes! No way we can compute this at compile time. At least not in C. But no way I am switching languages just because of this minor inconvenience. So runtime it is. 

`metadata_byte_size` is initialized with `0`. Every call to `salloc` or `salloc_aligned` then checks whether or not it was set to a nonzero value (like, actually initialized). If not, it then performs the necessary computation mentioned above. Now the metadata byte size is known. Hurray!

## Alignment

I've learned to compile my C programs with `-fsanitize=address,undefined`, ASan and UBSan. I may add some more in the future. You can read more about it [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html).

But why am I talking about this? Well, when I first tested the library, UBSan reported unaligned memory, which is actually an example of undefined behaviour. Since I compiled the program without optimizations, fortunately, no [nasal demons](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.std.c/c/ycpVKxTZkgw/m/S2hHdTbv4d8J) were involved. But no runtime error/warning looks good, eh?

Since I was oblivious to the fact that unaligned read and write are actually a huge problem, I completely ignored it, and happily issued blocks with starting addres at... wherever.

But issuing aligned memory, e.g. pointer of address divisible by the alignment of the data type we want to read/write seems to be very important. From what I've been told, some processors can handle it, like my 10th gen Intel Core i5, but for a performance cost. And some processors refuse to bother and just straight up terminate the program.

So I just introduced `..._aligned` versions of `salloc` and `srealloc` and performed some additional computation to actually issue an aligned block. And also made the `salloc` and `srealloc` both use the default alignment, which is actually a very pessimistic `16` bytes, but hey, it works!
